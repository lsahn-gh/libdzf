What is libdzf?
---------------
libdzf is an embeddable, type-independent, common data structures library based on C99 std.

One of the most difficulties in C programming is to implement data structures with Generic Programming concept, such as template in C++. 
That is why this began and is like a challenge. Because C does not support Object-Oriented Programming or Generic Programming. 
But we can make an workaround with preprocessor tricks. So implemented library is basically based on #define directive and those tricks.
